                Meet Our Founder
                <br>
                Robert MacKay is MacTutor’s founder and president. He is Florida’s 1st FileMaker 11, 12, 13 , 14, 15 & 16 Certified Developer and master FileMaker Authorized Trainer. “I offer you the BEST technology team to build your organization, the most beautiful, most efficient FileMaker, Mobile or Web project and, in the quickest most cost effective way. That is my goal.” Feeling a keen passion for technology since a young boy, Robert played with electronics and dismantled computers for as long as his mother can remember. Later in life the right opportunities presented themselves which allowed him to make his technological education a reality. That and a continuous learning (industry seminars and dealing face to face with today’s rapidly changing technologies) resulted in the knowledge that he now enjoys. His employment as an Apple Computer Trainer 19 years ago resulted in an unavoidable specialty with Macs which he soon expanded into a variety of other platforms, particularly the Windows platform. Today, MacTutor’s clients and staff can see that this hands-on technology background makes him the ideal leader for a company that doesn’t prejudice against any particular platform or technology. Robert prides himself in mastering a broad range of services and software for literally any platform or type of network. Like a composer, Robert is not only a musician but the mastermind behind what MacTutor delivers to its clients. With a hand-picked team of programmers, MacTutor conducts the orchestra that performs top of the line custom software. Robert lives with his wife, his two daughters Cecille and Natalie, and son Ian Connor – his other 4 passions. Robert is a FileMaker 10, 11, 12 & 13 Authorized Trainer and FileMaker 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 & 16 Certified Developer himself.

Not the common, run of the mill software programmers. Meet them. These guys are in love with their projects, they can’t sleep if they cannot solve a problem, they sometimes work through the night because they need to find an answer, they are a tight group, they pat each other on the back, they applaud themselves, they make odd funny noises in excitement, they actually MEET DEADLINES, they are geeky, amazing, unique. We are proud of them. After 18 years in this business, these guys still amaze me every day. One of my responsibilities is to hire this quality of people. Needless is to say, I recommend them.</p>
